00:15.730 --> 00:17.390
Good morning, Zenos.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.500
Time to get up.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.350
Good morning, Lily.

00:40.850 --> 00:42.730
I made some black tea.

00:42.730 --> 00:43.930
Thanks.

00:48.810 --> 00:51.980
<i>"A healer is third-rate if 
they just heal injuries,</i>

00:51.980 --> 00:53.970
<i>second-rate if they can 
wholly heal a person,</i>

00:53.970 --> 00:56.280
<i>and first-rate if they can 
make the world a better place."</i>

00:57.360 --> 01:02.050
<i>This is the Kingdom of Herzeth, a nation 
whose history is intertwined with healers.</i>

01:03.120 --> 01:06.830
<i>The contributions of 
healers helped it expand</i>

01:06.830 --> 01:09.260
<i>and gained it a position of real importance.</i>

01:10.090 --> 01:14.470
<i>The royal hospital is 
where many healers gather</i>

01:14.470 --> 01:17.220
<i>to learn more sophisticated healing magic</i>

01:17.220 --> 01:21.570
<i>and earn their license before 
beginning their journeys as healers.</i>

01:22.860 --> 01:26.850
<i>But in a corner of the kingdom, there's 
someone who didn't receive a formal education</i>

01:26.850 --> 01:29.470
<i>and doesn't have a license 
to practice healing.</i>

01:30.990 --> 01:32.540
Thanks again, man.

01:35.740 --> 01:36.990
Here's some cash.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.210
Don't worry about it.

01:39.210 --> 01:42.310
I'm always willing to heal if 
you're willing to pay the price.

01:43.150 --> 01:44.290
Thanks again!

01:45.880 --> 01:47.460
That was great, Zenos.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.710
You've got a house call today, right?

01:50.080 --> 01:52.860
Yeah. I'll be back before nightfall.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.930
Okay! I'll be ready and 
waiting with dinner by then.

01:56.930 --> 01:58.470
Have a safe trip!

01:59.010 --> 02:00.070
I'm heading out.

02:16.740 --> 02:20.610
Oh, Carmilla! Dinner isn't ready yet.

02:20.610 --> 02:22.240
Let's have a look...

02:22.240 --> 02:27.870
Stew, eh? I always look forward 
to your cooking, Lily!

02:28.620 --> 02:32.850
Leave it to me! 'Cuz I'm gonna 
be Zenos's wife someday!

02:32.850 --> 02:35.500
I can always cook something tasty!

02:37.280 --> 02:39.270
Such a hard worker.

02:39.270 --> 02:43.390
I believe I'll rest in my room for now, though.

02:45.970 --> 02:47.210
Doc?

02:48.110 --> 02:49.980
I'm here to visit.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.350
Huh? Is he not in?

02:52.350 --> 02:56.060
Zophia, Zenos is off on a house call.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.860
Seriously?

02:57.860 --> 03:00.940
I guess I'll wait until he gets back, then.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.420
I was hoping to have him to 
myself by showing up early...

03:09.680 --> 03:11.620
I figured you'd show.

03:11.620 --> 03:14.880
Sir Zenos! Lynga has come to see you.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.810
No one's around...

03:18.380 --> 03:20.880
Zenos is on a house call.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.010
Hey.

03:23.510 --> 03:29.020
Lynga was going to lick Sir Zenos 
all over while he fluffed my tail...

03:29.020 --> 03:33.020
I'm already waiting for Doc to get 
back, so how about you run on home?

03:33.020 --> 03:35.230
Lynga will be the one waiting.

03:38.610 --> 03:41.110
I actually live here!

03:42.560 --> 03:43.900
Guess you're right!

03:45.740 --> 03:47.740
She's here, too.

03:49.770 --> 03:52.620
Zenos! I've come for amusement.

03:52.620 --> 03:54.230
Where are you?

03:54.230 --> 03:57.380
Loewe, Zenos is on a house call.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.560
The others are inside.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.260
You can join us, but only after fixing the door.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.830
The whole gang's here, I see.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.140
You all copy Lynga.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.890
Let me guess: you both found the promise 
of Lily's cooking irresistible?

04:10.890 --> 04:12.660
No, that's just you.

04:17.860 --> 04:20.620
And now the secret ingredient...

04:22.640 --> 04:26.740
We'll be eating when Zenos gets back. 
Are you all going to join us?

04:26.740 --> 04:28.740
That was my intention.

04:28.740 --> 04:31.620
Since I'm here, I might as well.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.000
Of course, Lynga will eat, too!

04:37.340 --> 04:39.520
I'm looking forward to a group meal.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.130
But I'd better put the laundry away.

04:43.390 --> 04:45.920
Watch the pot, okay?

04:49.440 --> 04:52.270
Whatever it is, it smells good.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.390
I can't wait until dinner!

04:54.390 --> 04:56.400
I was thinking the same thing.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.670
Let's have a quick taste while it's still hot.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.160
This is amazing!

05:05.160 --> 05:06.240
Lynga, too!

05:06.540 --> 05:09.670
This isn't sneaking a bite. Just a taste test!

05:12.310 --> 05:13.370
I can't stop.

05:13.370 --> 05:17.880
Unbelievable... Lily is gonna 
be pissed at you two.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.950
That was Lynga's!

05:24.550 --> 05:28.950
Maybe just a sample, so I can learn 
how the doc likes his food seasoned...

05:44.670 --> 05:48.330
I hope Zenos gets back early.

05:53.910 --> 05:57.380
Well, this is a real mess 
we've gotten ourselves into.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.280
Lynga agrees.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.040
My stomach can attest to that.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.550
You two ate it all!

06:05.550 --> 06:08.800
Exactly! You two are unbelievable.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.680
Do you girls have amnesia or something?

06:11.680 --> 06:15.560
Oh, good idea! Lynga remembers nothing!

06:15.560 --> 06:18.560
I get it! We can just make more!

06:18.560 --> 06:21.120
So that's your plan, eh?

06:21.120 --> 06:23.660
I guess I'm in, then.

06:23.660 --> 06:26.570
Let's fill this pot up with ingredients.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.410
Would any of you care to 
explain what happened?

06:36.410 --> 06:40.290
Zophia. Lynga. Loewe.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.810
It's actually a complicated story...

06:45.810 --> 06:47.560
Lynga doesn't know.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.550
I'm not sure myself.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.440
I'm not sure I heard that right.

06:53.440 --> 06:57.770
One more time: please explain what happened.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.900
It smelled so good, I wanted to taste it...

07:02.900 --> 07:06.400
Lynga's hands moved on their own.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.740
It was very good!

07:10.270 --> 07:13.770
Great, now she's upset because of you two.

07:13.770 --> 07:15.800
Loewe eat too much!

07:15.800 --> 07:17.700
It was so good, I couldn't stop!

07:17.700 --> 07:19.590
Don't blame the food.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.840
I nearly ate the whole pot...

07:21.840 --> 07:23.810
That can't be good for digestion.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.520
I could always have Zenos 
check me out after.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.920
Don't waste Doc's time with 
that kind of nonsense.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.750
The fur on Lynga's tail is feeling rough,

07:32.750 --> 07:35.800
so I need Zenos to rub it like usual.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.060
Quit sharing your delusions with us.

07:38.060 --> 07:40.680
Zophia, jealousy is not becoming.

07:40.680 --> 07:46.020
Maybe instead of Lynga, you should be 
envious of this honed body of steel?

07:46.640 --> 07:50.000
Sir Zenos wouldn't like a bulgy mess!

07:50.000 --> 07:54.090
He likes Lynga's double serving of 
athletic slenderness and fluffy goodness!

07:54.090 --> 07:57.410
You two are getting way off track.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.510
Loser lizard is chirping again.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.760
You got something to say, pup?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.190
Don't leave me out.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.470
Stay out of it.

08:04.470 --> 08:05.630
Everyone...

08:06.860 --> 08:10.300
If you start fighting, Zenos will be mad.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.550
I was really hoping we 
could all eat together.

08:16.870 --> 08:18.560
I'm sorry, Lily.

08:18.820 --> 08:22.180
Sorry! Lynga will help make dinner!

08:22.180 --> 08:23.840
You'll have my aid, too.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.150
I can handle heavier tasks!

08:26.720 --> 08:31.150
We only had enough ingredients 
to make that one batch...

08:31.150 --> 08:32.750
Nothing else.

08:32.750 --> 08:33.900
Excuse me?

08:36.870 --> 08:38.660
So sorry!

08:39.080 --> 08:45.790
I was so looking forward to eating the 
stew Lily made... and you ate it all?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.420
Whatever should I do about that?

08:50.420 --> 08:53.800
Maybe I'll see what a soul that's 
been flavored with stew tastes like?

08:55.060 --> 08:56.840
You two, apologize!

08:56.840 --> 08:59.050
We're so sorry!

08:59.390 --> 09:00.930
Ingredients...

09:01.300 --> 09:05.310
I need you all to bring me more ingredients.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.650
Lynga will get what you need!

09:08.920 --> 09:10.870
Consider it done!

09:10.870 --> 09:13.400
I'll get you the real good stuff!

09:14.850 --> 09:17.410
I can get as much as you need!

09:23.410 --> 09:26.540
That was the last of the herbs, too...

09:26.890 --> 09:29.540
Shouldn't you have been angrier with them?

09:29.540 --> 09:32.170
I'm not that mad.

09:33.470 --> 09:36.010
You're certainly forgiving, Lily.

09:36.010 --> 09:39.530
If they had gotten into my 
liquor as well as the food,

09:39.530 --> 09:41.810
they'd have all been cursed.

09:42.090 --> 09:43.940
It's because I'm a grown-up!

09:46.070 --> 09:49.420
Plus, I like it when we're all together.

09:51.540 --> 09:56.000
I wonder if I'll be able to finish 
dinner by the time Zenos gets back...

10:10.820 --> 10:14.920
Unbelievable. Just what are you doing?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.820
What am I going to do with you?

10:18.820 --> 10:21.680
Where have you been?

10:21.680 --> 10:26.560
M-My stomach hurt, so I went to a hospital,

10:26.560 --> 10:29.690
but I didn't have any money, 
so they wouldn't see me...

10:30.830 --> 10:35.780
Do you really think a stomachache is enough 
to get you a reprieve? You, a slave?

10:35.780 --> 10:39.150
Ridiculous. Back to work with you.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.920
I-I'm so sorry!

10:56.630 --> 11:01.260
A grimy grave like this is perfectly 
suited to a grimy demihuman.

11:05.940 --> 11:09.520
This is pathetic. On your feet already!

11:09.520 --> 11:12.150
For you to give me all this trouble...

11:12.520 --> 11:16.270
Do you <i>want</i> to be in one of these graves?!

11:20.410 --> 11:23.030
That's enough loafing around.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.230
Hurry and find anything of value.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.170
You can't even talk anymore?

11:31.170 --> 11:33.300
Absolutely worthless.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.040
I'll be heading back now.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.180
You will be fed today... <i>if</i> you earn it.

11:50.270 --> 11:51.770
Blood?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.270
What are you doing?!

11:59.680 --> 12:02.690
Damn it. What is going on here?

12:07.570 --> 12:08.960
You there!

12:14.070 --> 12:17.630
My slave has gone mad and 
started attacking me!

12:17.630 --> 12:19.880
Can you do something?!

12:19.880 --> 12:21.630
What are you talking about?

12:21.630 --> 12:23.480
Kind of self-absorbed, aren't you?

12:24.570 --> 12:27.390
She's caught up with me! That's her!

12:32.430 --> 12:34.490
What were you doing?

12:34.490 --> 12:38.020
Just our usual work.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.350
What work is that?

12:40.510 --> 12:43.010
A bit of farming, that's all.

12:43.010 --> 12:46.280
Now, look at these wounds!

12:46.280 --> 12:49.200
I need to get to a hospital 
as soon as possible!

12:49.200 --> 12:52.540
If you can do something 
about her, I'll pay you!

12:56.730 --> 12:58.170
What's wrong?

12:58.170 --> 12:59.620
That was rather violent.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.380
You feeling all right?

13:04.980 --> 13:07.010
Quite impressive...

13:07.010 --> 13:09.440
Now do away with her!

13:09.440 --> 13:10.510
That's not happening.

13:10.830 --> 13:12.270
Why?

13:12.270 --> 13:15.270
My job isn't killing people.

13:15.270 --> 13:18.000
If you insist on that kind of nonsense,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.070
you could get me—an aristocrat—killed!

13:21.070 --> 13:25.490
She's just a slave! I can 
always buy a new one!

13:28.200 --> 13:32.580
Sorry, but I try to save any lives I can.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.290
And who do you think you are?

13:38.690 --> 13:40.000
A healer.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.850
What kind of healer can do that?!

13:55.730 --> 13:59.230
<i>She's fast. Faster than your 
average demihuman should be.</i>

14:22.420 --> 14:25.510
I'll get you up in a second. 
Just calm down for me.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.070
No, no, no...

14:30.150 --> 14:32.430
It hurts...

14:33.620 --> 14:36.590
I can't... anymore...

14:37.020 --> 14:38.870
That explains it.

14:43.430 --> 14:46.000
I've heard of dinner and conversation,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.110
but dinner and possession is new.

14:48.650 --> 14:51.410
I'll take care of you now. Heal.

14:58.410 --> 15:02.540
I wonder what kind of "farming" 
gets you possessed by ghosts.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.780
This takes care of today's work, though.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.640
Her broken leg was healed in an instant.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.390
He's incredibly powerful!

15:20.950 --> 15:26.150
Y-You there... You're actually a healer.

15:26.150 --> 15:28.150
Yeah, I am.

15:28.150 --> 15:31.030
Th-Then save me!

15:31.030 --> 15:33.840
I'm off the clock for today, actually.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.280
Can you hold out until tomorrow?

15:35.280 --> 15:39.660
Tomorrow? I'll die by then!

15:39.660 --> 15:41.800
Heal me right now!

15:41.800 --> 15:43.490
Right now, huh?

15:43.490 --> 15:46.630
It'll cost you a bit extra. Is that all right?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.270
That should more than suffice.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.510
Whoa.

15:53.510 --> 15:55.600
That's nowhere near enough.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.640
Th-That's not enough?!

15:58.640 --> 16:01.800
But it's already more than the market price!

16:01.800 --> 16:06.770
Do you really think a healer can fleece 
someone with such extravagant costs?!

16:08.270 --> 16:13.910
Well, I'm an underground healer 
without a license, so...

16:13.910 --> 16:18.540
Underground healer? Such a thing exists?

16:18.540 --> 16:20.990
It's an underworld gig. 
Kind of like grave-robbing.

16:21.910 --> 16:25.420
Grave-robbing? Whatever do you mean?

16:25.700 --> 16:28.080
Oh, right, "farming."

16:29.610 --> 16:30.960
In that case...

16:31.760 --> 16:34.970
I'll take her to make up the difference.

16:35.390 --> 16:39.720
Her? The slave?

16:40.070 --> 16:42.770
Do what you will with her!

16:43.170 --> 16:45.630
All right, you've got a deal.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.280
That's your payment taken care of.

16:53.130 --> 16:55.170
Bloody job's not worth the trouble...

17:06.040 --> 17:06.790
You awake?

17:08.260 --> 17:09.740
Ow...

17:10.250 --> 17:11.630
Who are you?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.730
I'm Zenos.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.510
I bought you.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.100
How's your name pronounced?

17:18.830 --> 17:21.020
I'm Til.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.890
You... bought me?

17:24.890 --> 17:28.400
Yeah. Now strip, Til.

17:29.770 --> 17:31.920
You cost a lot.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.780
I've gotta make sure 
you're in good condition.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.000
Right...

17:59.260 --> 18:01.010
I knew it.

18:01.310 --> 18:04.390
There's a gallstone blocking your 
bile duct, causing inflammation.

18:04.390 --> 18:06.810
You were hunched over as 
if you had abdominal pain.

18:06.810 --> 18:09.900
That and the jaundice caught 
my interest, so I followed you.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.340
I'll fix you right up.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.780
What just happened?

18:19.780 --> 18:21.030
What do you mean?

18:21.030 --> 18:24.290
I opened you up, took the stone 
out, and closed you back up.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.320
No incantation, no magic circle...

18:28.320 --> 18:30.310
No trace of an opening, either!

18:31.040 --> 18:34.320
Any healer could pull that off.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.510
You can do all that, Master?!

18:37.510 --> 18:39.130
It's just normal.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.950
No, it's not!

18:44.010 --> 18:47.730
Thank you for curing me.

18:47.730 --> 18:49.320
I don't know how to thank you...

18:49.320 --> 18:51.110
You really think thanks are enough?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.920
What I want is an equal price.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.900
That means it's time for you to get to work.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.280
Wh-Whatever you want!

18:59.280 --> 19:02.500
I'll pay you back as your slave!

19:05.540 --> 19:07.980
Ask... whatever you want.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.170
Could you show me where to find this?

19:13.450 --> 19:15.040
Or not?

19:15.040 --> 19:16.540
I-I can.

19:19.140 --> 19:20.730
Right this way, please.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.890
Is this right?

19:32.160 --> 19:34.150
It sure is.

19:34.150 --> 19:35.930
Thanks, Til.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.580
Thanks aren't necessary.

19:39.580 --> 19:42.530
But is this really all you need?

19:42.930 --> 19:47.540
I was anticipating... a lot more.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.660
And I'm willing to...

19:49.660 --> 19:51.670
Nah, you did your job.

19:52.810 --> 19:54.610
What do you mean?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.180
Just what I said.

19:56.180 --> 20:00.010
But, Master, I'm indebted to you!

20:00.010 --> 20:02.480
And like I said, you paid me back.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.060
I always demand a fair 
price for the labor I do,

20:05.060 --> 20:07.760
and I always pay a fair price 
for what I expect others to do.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.930
I haven't done anything yet.

20:11.930 --> 20:13.090
You found the leaves.

20:14.050 --> 20:17.650
Leaves I couldn't have found on my own.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.030
B-But those are just...

20:20.030 --> 20:24.220
Point is, their value is equal 
to what I did for you.

20:26.030 --> 20:27.780
All debts are settled.

20:28.070 --> 20:29.790
Your life's your own now.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.970
My life is... my own?

20:36.350 --> 20:40.260
What... I would like to do now is...

20:43.970 --> 20:46.210
I don't really know.

20:46.680 --> 20:50.180
But now that I'm not a slave, 
I'm going to live to find out!

20:50.890 --> 20:54.270
And when I do find out, 
I'll come and tell you!

20:54.270 --> 20:58.590
Is that all right, Zenos?

20:58.590 --> 20:59.330
Sure.

21:00.270 --> 21:02.130
See you around, Til.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.330
If you get hurt, come and see me.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.910
I can take care of you 
as an underground healer.

21:06.910 --> 21:09.240
But not for free, of course.

21:14.470 --> 21:15.640
I'm back.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.290
Welcome back, Zenos.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.830
D-Dinner's not ready yet...

21:24.060 --> 21:25.630
Zenos!

21:24.060 --> 21:25.630
Sir Zenos!

21:24.060 --> 21:25.630
Doc!

21:25.630 --> 21:27.640
What are you three doing here?

21:27.640 --> 21:30.430
Maybe don't ask, okay?

21:30.430 --> 21:32.530
Lynga didn't do anything wrong.

21:32.530 --> 21:35.270
I assure you, I did not sneak any food!

21:35.270 --> 21:39.190
Vegetables, fish, and lots of meat!

21:39.190 --> 21:41.120
I gotta make the most of all this!

21:44.470 --> 21:47.950
You seem to have had some fun.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.160
Didn't see you up there.

21:51.280 --> 21:56.190
Well, well, is that a new 
girl I sense you've met?

21:56.190 --> 21:57.670
Quit poking fun.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.060
Since everyone brought so much,

22:04.060 --> 22:06.380
I can make a whole bunch of food!

22:06.380 --> 22:08.760
Yeah? Sounds good.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.010
Just you wait!

22:16.520 --> 22:18.550
I'll make some black tea first,

22:18.550 --> 22:20.270
and we can drink it together!

22:22.550 --> 22:23.330
Sure.

23:55.580 --> 24:00.040
The Underground Healer in 
the Abandoned Part of Town

23:56.880 --> 23:59.040
"The Underground Healer in 
the Abandoned Part of Town."
